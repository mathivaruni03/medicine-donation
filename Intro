India is developing at a fast pace and has made quick walks in many fields since its autonomy. But, according to many researches and National Family Health Survey (NFHS), it is clear that the admittance to medical care is still a rising issue in many slums and rural areas. Tough India is classified as a developing country, poverty is still a major challenge. The Per Capita GDP in India is still around $1900, by which it is clear that many people in India still lack expensive medical care and are deprived of healthcare facilities.

Due to the poverty and illiteracy, the people below poverty line cannot/do not want to pay for the expensive medical care because the cost of many medicines is so high that they prefer to buy food over medicines. Due to this issue, they suffer many diseases that turn into life-threatening issues if not taken care in time. Whereas, people whose per capita income is more and stable can afford these medical products and also preserve them for future need.
